Hi! This site is still under development. I'm creating a personal repository, which will be used for academic/blog/notes purposes. Maybe I'll post some code too.

The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) can be helpful if you're trying to make a website like this one.
