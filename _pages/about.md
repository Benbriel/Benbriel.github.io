I'm a Physics undergraduate who just learned how to create a public website. This is still under development, so it'll be a while before it's finished. I'm trying to make it a personal repository, which I'll be using for academic/blog/notes purposes. Maybe I'll post some code too.

The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) can be helpful if you're trying to make a website like this one.
