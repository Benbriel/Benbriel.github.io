These are some important equations for a course on Electrodynamics. First, we start with the obvious Maxwell's equations

$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} ={\frac {\rho }{\varepsilon _0}}$$
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf {B} = 0 $$
$$\nabla \times \mathbf {E} =-\partial_t \mathbf{B} $$
$$\nabla \times \mathbf {B} =\mu _{0}\left(\mathbf {J} +\varepsilon _{0}\partial_t \mathbf {E} \right) $$

And that's it! (WIP)
