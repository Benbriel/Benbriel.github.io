The response of graphene transistors (GFETs) passivated with an Al2O3 layer to an incident laser was studied. The wavelength of the laser, Drain-Source voltage, and Gate voltage were varied, modeling the response signal as a two-time characteristic RC current. The relationship between the control variables and the characteristic response times was obtained.
